        <h2><strong>What is web development?</strong></h2>
        <br>
        A web developer’s job is to create websites. While their primary role is to ensure the website is visually
        appealing and easy to navigate, many web developers are also responsible for the website’s performance and
        capacity.
        <br>

        <h2><strong>Types of web developers</strong></h2>
        <br>
        Web developers usually fall under one of three categories: back-end developers, front-end developers, and
        full-stack developers. Some web developers also work as webmasters. Let’s take a closer look at each of
        these roles.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Back-end web developers</strong> create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code
                works. Their responsibilities also may include managing access points for others who need to manage a
                website's
                content.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Front-end web developers</strong> work on the visual part of the website. The pages visitors see
                and interact with (also known as the user interface). They design the physical layout of each page,
                integrate graphics,
                and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Full-stack developers</strong> do the work of both a back-end and front-end developer. These
                developers have the knowledge to build a complete website and may work for
                organizations that don’t have the budget for a large website team.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Webmasters</strong> are essentially website managers. Their primary responsibility is
                to keep the website updated, ensuring that the links and applications on each page work properly.
            </li>

        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
        <h2><strong>Web developer tasks and responsibilities</strong></h2>
        <br>
        As a web developer, you could work for a company or agency, or as a freelancer taking on projects for
        individual clients. Your tasks will vary depending on your work situation, but day-to-day responsibilities
        might generally include:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Designing user interfaces and navigation menus
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Writing and reviewing code for sites, typically HTML, XML, or JavaScript
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Integrating multimedia content onto a site
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Testing web applications
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Troubleshooting problems with performance or user experience
            </li><br>

            <li>
                Collaborating with designers, developers, and stakeholders
            </li><br>
        </ul>

        <p>
        <h2><strong>Web developer career path</strong></h2><br>
        Many web developers start their careers with a single focus, usually front-end or back-end development. They
        may move on to be full-stack developers or explore careers in related fields, including project management,
        computer programming, or graphic design.
        <br>

        <h2><strong>How much do web developers make?</strong></h2><br>
        The median annual salary for web developers in the US is $78,300, according to the Bureau of Labor
        Statistics (BLS) [1]. However, web developers in the US can earn up to $249,297 according to Glassdoor
        salary insights [2]. How much you earn will depend on many factors, including where you work, what industry
        you work in, and how much experience you have. BLS estimates 23 percent industry growth for web developers between 2021-2031, a faster-than-average rate
        compared to other occupations. One of the driving forces behind this increase in web development jobs is the
        growth of e-commerce. Companies are becoming more reliant on functioning websites that operate on multiple
        devices to do business.
