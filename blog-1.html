            JavaScript is embedded with various tools which enhance the working of the application. These JavaScript
            tools can be IDEs, Frameworks, and Libraries. Let’s get a basic idea about these tools.
            <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>IDEs –</strong> It is a platform where developers implement code to create applications. You can
                edit code, debug it and work on commands using integrated CLI. For Example VS Code, Eclipse, and Atom.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Frameworks –</strong> They are used to build applications, and act as a structure to hold
                applications. Code redundancy can be avoided using the framework. It can also include programs,
                libraries, and APIs. For
                Example: React, Angular, and Vue.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <strong>Libraries –</strong> It is a collection of functions to perform an operation that can be used
                for quick implementation. For Example mocha, socket.io, webpack, and npm.
                In this blog, we will discuss 15 must-have JavaScript Tools for Developers. So let’s get started.

            In this blog, we will discuss 15 must-have JavaScript Tools for Developers. So let’s get started.
            <br>
        <ul class="list-non-bullet">
            <li>
                <h2><strong>IDEs</strong></h2>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Visual Studio Code - </strong>According to Stack Overflow 2019, Visual Studio Code is ranked as
                the
                best leading tool or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for JavaScript development. It is
                compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS. This generates both managed and native code. Adding
                additional features and plugins allows you to customize and extend it. It incorporates syntax
                highlighting, Git control, and much more. The Git support allows you to operate commands like commit,
                publish, pull, and push.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Eclipse - </strong>Eclipse is the second most popular IDE among developers which is developed
                using Java. Although, it has a plugin for any programming language for which a plug-in is available most
                developers prefer it for JavaScript. Ecplise works completely fine in Windows, Mac, and Linux. Project
                management is also a key feature of Eclipse which makes it more accessible with the automated features.
                Moreover, to enhance its performance, it supports Docker images, new Docker UI, and Docker CLI. It is
                the best for running under the GNU classpath.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Atom - </strong>An atom is built on the Electron framework which is used to build cross-platform
                apps for desktops. It is completely free and open-source Atom is compatible with Windows and Mac. The
                best feature is its transition from the text editor to IDE developed with Facebook. It also comes with
                an integrated package manager. You can easily customize the IDE without making any changes to the
                configuration file and also apply themes to enhance its look. Plugins written in HTML, CSS, JS, and
                NodeJS are also supported by JavaScript.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Sublime Text - </strong>Sublime Text is a cross-platform text editor with Python API. It
                supports multiple languages and plugins can also be installed. It is compatible with Windows, Mac, and
                Linux. It is the most popular code editor by Stack Overflow. It’s open-source and cross-platform and has
                also a customization feature. Installing third-party plugins is possible through its package manager
                called Package Control. It also helps in performing simultaneous editing (making the same interactive
                changes to multiple selected areas) and also quick navigation to files.</li>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>AngularJS - </strong>Angular, a powerful JavaScript framework developed by Google, boosts your
                application in terms of speed, responsive UI, and various other factors. It is an open-source framework
                generally used for single-page applications. It is included in the MEAN (MongoDB Express Angular NodeJS)
                stack. It follows easier DOM manipulation. There’s no requirement of writing databases, user interfaces,
                and links (model-view-controller) separately. It has the feature of extending HTML into the application
                to dependency injection and data binding. The command “npm install -g @angular/CLI” installs Angular
                globally.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>ReactJS - </strong>React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for user interfaces. It
                is the future of web development, more than 1300 developers and over 94,000 sites use ReactJS. It
                creates interactive UIs and is component-based. The main reason developers use React is the reusability
                of the code which saves time and helps in bringing optimized solutions. It is absolute to mention that
                companies like Apple, PayPal, and many others use it for their websites. Also, developers get to work
                with React Hooks which uses functional components which can be used across the project. The command “npx
                create-react-app file_name“ where npx is the package and create-react-app creates a default folder where
                you will have a default code of “Hello World” using port 3000 and file_name is the file name which you
                want to give.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>VueJS - </strong>Vue is another open-source front-end UI framework in JavaScript, also reliable
                for cross-platform development. Vue supports all browsers and is compatible with Windows, Mac, and
                Linux. Vue also has a web interface to visualize the different parts of an application and also supports
                fragments and portals. The dual integration mode for creating high-end Single Page Applications.
                Handling an app of any size is super easy with Vue and it covers both apps, a large scale or small
                scale. The plugin system lets you add things like a network, backend support, and state management. The
                command “vue create my-app” installs Vue with the file_name being my-app.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>ExpressJS - </strong>Express is an open-source and back-end framework for NodeJS. It provides
                server-side logic for building single-page, multi-page, and hybrid web applications. It is fast, stable,
                and can build APIs very easily. Easy to configure and customize the application using Express. You can
                install it using the command “npm install express –save” where npm is the node package manager and –save
                saves it to the dependency file. The command “npm install -g express-generator” installs express
                globally using -g.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>EmberJS - </strong>Websites like Netflix, LinkedIn, and Nordstrom use Ember which is a
                productive, JavaScript framework used to build web applications. It has rich documentation for each of
                its versions and uses modern JavaScript with classes, generators, and decorators. It is more flexible
                for backend applications. It provides CLI integrated with Ember for better productivity. To increase the
                rendering speed, it provides a Glimmer rendering engine which is the most important feature Ember has.

            <li><strong>jQuery - </strong>jQuery is a lightweight, fast and cross-platform library that is used for the
                DOM (Document Object Model) manipulation, for the front-end processes. It is used 3 to 4 times more than
                any other JavaScript library. It helps the developers with its feature of adding plug-ins, creating
                animations, and navigating documents. Companies like Google, MSN, and DailyMotion use jQuery to build
                their client-side application. It creates dynamic web pages. It is so extensible and versatile, also you
                “write less, do more” using jQuery.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Webpack - </strong>Webpack, a module bundler, is a tool that helps you in compiling JavaScript
                modules. It compresses a large number of files into a single one and runs the application. It is of
                great help to the DevOps team giving them the way to organize their deployment files. It loads modules
                with dependencies like .css, .js, .jpg and .sass into the browser. It creates excellent web applications
                while managing JavaScript files. Its main purpose is to bundle JS files and is capable of transforming,
                bundling, or packaging.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>Mocha - </strong>Mocha is an open-source JavaScript test framework that is used for testing test
                cases asynchronously. It allows developers to track and report on the ongoing function. It runs
                automated tests in NodeJS. Unlike any other, Mocha can be used with third-party assertions and spying
                tools. It helps in creating descriptive auto-test and reports. It has great support for both Test-Driven
                Development (TDD) and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD).
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>NPM - </strong>Npm is the Node Package Manager for the JS platform. It is also an online repo
                where you can publish projects. Approximately 11 million developers use npm across the world. You can
                also find thousands of reusable code packages. It works with two tasks: default and arbitrary. It has
                greater plugins and packages. It functions in two ways – an online platform and CLI, using the online
                platform developers can share and upload tools, and using CLI, developers can have interactions like
                managing versions, installing packages, and managing the dependent tools.
            </li>
            <br>

            <li><strong>ESLint - </strong>ESLint is a tool that is used to identify and report patterns found in
                ECMAScript to make the code more consistent and avoid bugs. Companies like Netflix, Google, Atlassian,
                Microsoft, and Domain have already used it for the application. It supports Windows, Mac, and Linux. The
                best thing is that it can be configured according to the developer’s needs. Here “lint” refers to
                examining the code for errors. You should have NodeJS installed in your system to use ESLint. The
                command to install it is “npm install eslint –save-dev”
            </li>
            <br>
